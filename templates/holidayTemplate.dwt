    <h2> About My Holiday</h2>
      
    <p> Christmas is a holiday that is celebrated across the world, and has its origins with the birth of Christ in Christianity. Over the years, it has evolved, and today, has become a holiday that, to many, means coming together and giving to one another.  Usually in the days leading up to Christmas, members of a family get together, listen to Christmas themed music and watch/read Christmas based media.  On the day of Christmas, the day usually starts with opening gifts left underneath a "Christmas tree," left by members of the family, or the elusive, "Santa Claus," for the children. </p>

    <h2> My Special Holdiay Meaning </h2>
      
    <p> For me, Christmas has a ton of special memories traveling to visit relatives several hours away. Making cookies with my grandparents and  getting to open presents, hoping to get what I wanted for Christmas always excited me as a child, and the feeling of joy that I got when I got what I wanted was wonderful. </p>
